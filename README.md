Users can start to investigate by selecting/searching for 1 protein. A mouse over highlights protein data extracted from index cards, statistics of direct neighbors (such as interaction types), meta data  (publication summary and/or TimeArcs visualization of the selected protein and its direct neighbors), context data, and potential conflicts (for example a index card visualization matrix of immediate neighbors). The 3 latest items are works in progress. A mouse click will expand the direct neighbors iteratively.
