BioLinker visualization contains multiple views: the overview, context view, main view, conflict matrix, and publication view. 
Edges in the networks are encoded by interaction types such as green for add modification, red for remove modification.

Users can start to investigate by selecting/searching for a protein. A mouse over highlights protein data extracted from index cards, statistics of direct neighbors (such as interaction types), meta data  (publication summary and/or [TimeArcs](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/TimeArcs) visualization of the selected protein and its direct neighbors), context data, and potential conflicts (for example a  [index card visualization matrix]( https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/IndexCardVisualizations) of immediate neighbors). The three latest items are works in progress. A mouse click expands the direct neighbors iteratively.
