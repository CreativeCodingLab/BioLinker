Users can start to investigate by selecting/searching for a protein. A mouse over highlights protein data extracted from index cards, statistics of direct neighbors (such as interaction types), meta data  (publication summary and/or [TimeArcs](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/TimeArcs) visualization of the selected protein and its direct neighbors), context data, and potential conflicts (for example a  [index card visualization matrix]( https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/IndexCardVisualizations) of immediate neighbors). The three latest items are works in progress. A mouse click expands the direct neighbors iteratively.
